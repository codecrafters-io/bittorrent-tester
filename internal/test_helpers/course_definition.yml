        I think the instant feedback right there in the git push is really cool.
        Didn't even know that was possible!

stages:
  - slug: "init"
    name: "Match a literal character"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |
      In this stage, we'll handle the simplest regex possible: a single character. 

      **Example:** `a` should match "apple", but not "dog".

      Your program will be executed like this: 

      ```bash
      $ echo "apple" | ./script.sh -E "a"
      ```

      The `-E` flag instructs `grep` to interprets patterns as extended regular expressions (with support 
      for metacharacters like `+`, `?` etc.). We'll use this flag in all stages.

      You program must [exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) with 0 if the character is found, and 1 if not.
